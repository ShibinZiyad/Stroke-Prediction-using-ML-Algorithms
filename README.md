Stroke Prediction using ML Algorithms
The main objective of this project is to design a robust machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of stroke based on multiple health parameters and demographic characteristics. Stroke is the most common cause of death and disability worldwide while early diagnosis plays significant part in timely interventions and better patient outcomes. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether predictive models developed using machine learning algorithms can help in identifying those individuals with higher chances of developing a stroke. The report provides a background information on stroke, theory behind machine learning methods, requirements for hardware and software, implementation details and evaluation of model feasibility including use of appropriate measures.

**OBJECTIVE**
I would like to build a machine learning model that will be able to predict stroke with high degree of accuracy. To achieve this, I have done the following things:

1. Measure Different Machine Learning Algorithms:
Review the predictive abilities of multiple algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forests and support vector machines (SVM).
Evaluate how well these algorithms perform by using relevant metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.
2. Identification of Key Risk Factors:
Check for all variables in the dataset to find out what correlates with a stroke.
Identify which factors are most important in terms of predicting an occurrence of stroke.
3. Boost Patient Care:
Providing physicians with another resource other than their own instincts when assessing patients’ risk for having a stroke is crucial because there is no single sign which determines if someone has had a stroke or not.
Offering timely predictions about risks associated with strokes improved outcomes for patients.

**1. Background of the Project**
Stroke is a serious illness that can be caused by blocking or reducing blood flow to a part of the brain, which results in death of brain cells and possible long-term disabilities. It poses major public health issues for individuals, families, and healthcare delivery systems globally. Early diagnosis and prompt response are necessary to reduce stroke incidence rates and improve patient outcomes.

Machine learning is one branch of artificial intelligence with great prospects in several medical fields such as disease prediction and risk evaluation. Machine learning models employing extensive data sets, as well as sophisticated algorithms have the potential to detect patterns and correlations between items (e.g., poor health) and outcome variables pertaining to strokes.

**2. The Need for Machine Learning in Stroke**
Machine learning algorithms have the potential to change the face of future care for patients with stroke by Machine learning algorithms have the potential to change the face of future care for patients with stroke by:

Early stroke detection : Seeing patient data involving blood test results or scans and recognizing those having high odds of having a stroke in future.
Improved diagnosis : Aiding medical professionals to make quite a decision between different types of stroke and providing directions on optimal treatment method.
Personalized treatment plans: Customizing the mode of treatment to consider the unique attributes of every individual patient, coupled with their underlying risks.
Predictors of stroke recovery: Determining how likely a patient is to make a full recovery and identifying key intervention points. Your challenge is to rewrite the given sentence. Do not change the meaning but find your own style.

**Summary**

This project aimed to build a machine learning-model based system for predicting stroke. Thorough data preparation was vital and entailed handling of missing values in the ‘bmi’ column as well as systematically identifying and eliminating outliers to ensure a clean dataset for modeling. Exploratory data analysis utilized multiple visualizations (pie charts, bar plots, histograms, distplots, violin plots, correlation matrices, catplots and pairplots) to uncover linkages, distributions and underlying patterns within the data.  The categorical variables were converted into numerical equivalents using label encoding that are compatible with machine learning algorithms.  We thoroughly deployed Decision Trees Logistic Regression KNN Random Forest SVM and examined their performances by applying accuracy scores and confusion matrices and using this algorithm efficiently I am able to predict whether the patient is have the chances of getting the stroke in the future. This are the accuracy scores of the algorithm which I have used in the project
Decision Tree: 0.9021
Logistic Regression: 0.9383
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 0.9344
Random Forest: 0.9363
Support Vector Machines (SVM): 0.9393


**Result**
This project produced excellent results. The logistic regression and SVM classifiers proved their robustness as they had an impressive 93% accuracy for predicting stroke or not; A clear implication is that these models can be applied specifically to this data set to solve the problem of contingency prediction. The success of these models highlights the importance of selecting the right algorithm as an important factor affecting the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in healthcare
